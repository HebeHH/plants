# Build Log

## Initial Setup

### Project Creation (2025-07-27)
- Starting with original-onepage-app.tsx that contains a complete Plant Species Dashboard in a single file
- Goal: Refactor into a proper TypeScript application with componentized structure

### Environment Setup
1. Creating package.json with necessary dependencies ✓
   - Added React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Recharts, and Papaparse
   - Configured build scripts for development and production
2. Setting up TypeScript configuration ✓
   - Created tsconfig.json with strict mode enabled
   - Set up path aliases for cleaner imports
   - Added separate tsconfig for node (Vite)
3. Installing required npm packages
   - Created Vite configuration
   - Set up Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
   - Created entry point files (index.html, main.tsx)

### Component Extraction (2025-07-27)

1. Created TypeScript types and interfaces ✓
   - PlantSpecies interface for data structure
   - Enum types for categorical fields
   - Chart data types
   - Taxonomy validation types

2. Created constants ✓
   - Extracted enumFields configuration
   - Separated color schemes for charts

3. Created utility functions ✓
   - CSV parser with data cleaning
   - Chart helper functions
   
4. Extracted common components ✓
   - FileUpload component with validation display
   - Header component
   - TabNavigation component
   - StatCard component

5. Created data processing utilities and hooks ✓
   - Data processing functions for statistics calculation
   - Taxonomy validation logic
   - useFilters hook for data filtering
   - useSorting hook for table sorting
   - useDataProcessing hook for derived data

6. Created Tab components ✓
   - SummaryTab with statistics display
   - Placeholder tabs for Graphs, Taxonomy, and Table

7. Created Filter components ✓
   - TextFilter for search functionality
   - MultiSelectFilter for enum fields
   - FilterSection to organize all filters

   - Integration of all components
   - Basic routing between upload and dashboard views

### Component Refactoring Complete (2025-07-27)

1. Successfully extracted all components ✓
   - All tabs are now separate components
   - Charts are componentized (SunburstChart created inline in TaxonomyTab)
   - Filters are modular and reusable

2. Application structure ✓
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - TypeScript fully integrated
   - All hooks and utilities properly typed

3. Current status ✓
   - Application compiles successfully
   - All functionality from original file preserved
   - Ready for testing with CSV data

### Next Steps
- Test with actual CSV data
- Add error boundaries
- Optimize performance for large datasets
- Add unit tests
